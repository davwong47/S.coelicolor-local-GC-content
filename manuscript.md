## Introduction

*Streptomyces coelicolor* is a bacterium that can produce a range of natural products of pharmaceutical relevance. 

In 2002 the genome of *S. coelicolor* A3(2), the model actinomycete organism, was sequenced. In this study we investigate the local GC content of this organism.

## Methodology

The genome of *S. coelicolor* A3(2) was downloaded from the Sanger Centre ftp site.

The local GC content was then calculated using a sliding window of 100 KB and a 50KB step size.

## Results

The mean of the local GC content is 72.1% with a standard deviation of 1.1.

## Concludion

There is little variation in the local GC content of *S. coelicolor* A3(2).
